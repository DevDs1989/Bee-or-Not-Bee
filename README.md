# Bee-or-Not-Bee
Image classification project using scikit learn and opencv to differentiate between bees and beewolfs

### Background 
Beewolfs are a type of wasp that preys on bees. They are often mistaken for bees, but they are not. Bees are vital for the ecosystem as they play a large role in pollination This project uses a machine learning model to differentiate between the two.

## Linux
```
$ python3 -m venv sklearn-env
$ source sklearn-env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 bee_or_not_bee.py
```
## Windows
```
$ python -m venv sklearn-env
$ \sklearn-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python bee_or_not_bee.py
```

## Test the model
```
$ python test_model.py
```
